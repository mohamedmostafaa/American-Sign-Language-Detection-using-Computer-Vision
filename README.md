# Parkinson's Disease Recognition
Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement.

In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.

Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms. Occasionally, your doctor may suggest surgery to regulate certain regions of your brain and improve your symptoms.

### Symptoms

* **Tremors:** A tremor, or shaking, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers. 
* **Slowed movement:** Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you walk. It may be difficult to get out of a chair. You may drag your feet as you try to walk.
* **Rigid muscles:** Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body. The stiff muscles can be painful and limit your range of motion.
* **Writing changes:** It may become hard to write, and your writing may appear small.

### Solution

A 2017 study found that Parkinson's can be detected using
* Speed of Drawing
* Pen Pressure

We’ll be leveraging the fact that two of the most common Parkinson’s symptoms include tremors and muscle rigidity which directly impact the visual appearance of a hand drawn spiral and wave. The variation in visual appearance will enable us to train a computer vision + deep learning algorithm to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease.
